The Orange County\n              Transportation Authority (OCTA) needed to help the county find an\n              easy and helpful way to view updates on things like construction,\n              lane closures, reduced parking and Streetcar routes. OCTA was\n              intrested in in taking on this challenge with an app for their\n              users, were the users could view news and updates regarding the OC\n              Streetcar. The streetcar will operate between the Santa Ana\n              Regional Transportation Center to a new Harbor Transit Center in\n              Garden Grove, offering a link to downtown Santa Ana, one of Orange\n              County's largest centers for employment, arts, and entertainment,\n              as well as nearby residential neighborhoods, parks, and trails. .\n            </p>\n            <div>\n              <div class=\"one-column\">\n                <h3>Project Timeline </h3>\n                <p>6 months</p>\n                <h3>Role</h3>\n                <p>Product Designer</p>\n              </div>\n              <div class=\"two-column\">\n                <h3>Tools Used</h3>\n                <p>Figma, Framer Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop</p>\n                <h3>Project Type</h3>\n                <p>Transportation, Product Design, UI Design, UX Design</p>\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <div\n              style={{\n                display: \"flex\",\n                flexDirection: \"column\",\n                alignItems: \"left\",\n                width: \"100%\",\n                height: \"600px\",\n                marginTop: \"200px\",\n                marginBottom: 30,\n              }}\n            >\n              <h2>Final Prototype</h2>\n\n              <iframe\n                width=\"100%\"\n                height=\"100%\"\n                src=\"https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FhOOJD0Mwrapo5qSKDn7wL1%2FOC-Streetcar-App%3Fpage-id%3D0%253A1%26node-id%3D6%253A2%26viewport%3D360%252C48%252C0.11%26scaling%3Dscale-down%26starting-point-node-id%3D1%253A2\"\n              ></iframe>\n            </div>\n            <h2>Objective</h2>\n            <p>\n              Provide information to the people that commute and would be\n              affected most by the OC Streetcar with things like construction\n              progress, daily traffic impacts, road closures, utility work etc.\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              Once I had a good understanding of main objectives and the users\n              that would be needing this app, I began to create 2 personas of\n              what would be considered everyday riders of public transportation\n              in Orange County. This would give me a clearer idea of the needs\n              this app would cater and help me design a better experience for\n              the users.\n            </p>\n            <hr></hr>\n            <div className=\"content\" style={{ marginTop: \"4%\", width: \"100%\" }}>\n              <img src={ResearchImg}></img>\n            </div>\n            <h2>Research</h2>\n            <p>\n              After reviewing the survey results that were sent to the residents\n              of Orange County, I was able to have a better understanding how\n              the great amount of resedients travel and with ths information I\n              could hypothesis better how users were going to use the app.\n            </p>\n            <hr></hr>\n            <div className=\"content\" style={{ marginTop: \"4%\", width: \"100%\" }}>\n              <img src={PersonasImg}></img>\n            </div>\n            <h2>User Personas</h2>\n            <p>\n              I created two user personas to get a deeper understanding of users\n              needs. With a stronger understanding of the point of view from the\n              users angle, their expectations, concerns and motivations. This\n              would help me gain a different perspective when starting to\n              brainstorm and throughout the whole process.\n              <br></br>\n              <br></br>\n              From the research and personas it was clearer to see that the\n              target audience of this app would be residents that cared very\n              much about traffic and parking. Many design decisions were made\n              thinking about this type of user which I hypothesized that would\n              be around 80% of the whole user base.\n            </p>\n            <br></br>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default ProjectOC\n","import React from \"react\"\nimport Layout from \"../components/layout\"\nimport SEO from \"../components/seo\"\nimport ProjectOC from \"../components/project-OCstreetcar\"\n// Components\nimport Footer from \"../components/Footer\"\n\nconst projectTwo = () => (\n  <Layout>\n    <ProjectOC></ProjectOC>\n    <Footer></Footer>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default projectTwo\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/personas-bc7d405affcca43e2d1795014a2399cb.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/header-842b347d6c6b2caa8cb56ad084c12a7d.jpg\";","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/research-9716641b640d0d99e907f0f87ffc7898.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
